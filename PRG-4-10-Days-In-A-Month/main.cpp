//  Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (letting the user enter an integer
//  in the range of 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number
//  of days in that month. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
//
//  1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and
//     only if it is divisible by 400. For eample, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
//  2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by
//     4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
//
//  Here is a sample run of the program:
//  Enter a month (1-12): 2 ENTER
//  Enter a year: 2008 ENTER
//  29 days
